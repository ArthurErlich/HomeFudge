The ideal case for the Game Prototype would be to have two Destroyers in a battle with each other using Fudge's Network ability for two players and an AI variant of the battle. The worst-case scenario is to have the Gatling Turret player-controlled to destroy incoming asteroids. This Prototype will look into Fudges Performance and capabilities. There will be many Vector3 Calculations for Bullets, Aiming and Movement. This will decide how many moving Objects are rendered on the scene.
